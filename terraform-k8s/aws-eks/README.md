# Automatic Deployment of Spotfire Platform on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) using Spotfire containers images and Helm charts

## Overview

This **Spotfire QuickStart in Amazon EKS** shows how to automatically deploy the [Spotfire platform](https://www.spotfire.com/) on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) using container images and Helm charts.

**Note**: The purpose of this quickstart example is to provide a starting point for automatic deployment of Spotfire. This quickstart is not for production usage. This quickstart example can be easily extended and customized for production usage.

**Note**: This quickstart example has been verified with Spotfire 12.5 release, but it may work for other Spotfire versions with minimal modifications.

### Which kind of Spotfire environment is deployed by this quickstart example?

This quickstart has 2 main parts:

1. Deploy the required infrastructure components (using Terraform templates):
   - Virtual Private Cloud: AWS VPC.
   - Kubernetes cluster: AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
   - OCI registry: AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

2. Deploy the Spotfire environment (using the Spotfire CDK) in the created infrastructure:
   - All typical services in a Spotfire platform environment, using the Spotfire container images and Helm charts

The following diagram shows the deployed environment by this **Quickstart for Spotfire in EKS**:

**Note**: This quickstart uses the [Spotfire Cloud Deployment Kit](https://github.com/spotfiresoftware/spotfire-cloud-deployment-kit/tree/main) to build and deploy the Spotfire container images and Helm charts.
For more information, see the project's documentation and examples.

**Note**: This quickstart has been customized and extended from [Provision an EKS Cluster learn guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/kubernetes/provision-eks-cluster).
For more information and extending the example, see [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest].

## Prerequisites

- Required **Spotfire** installation packages.
- A **Linux host** with admin permissions to build and execute the containers.
    You can use a bare metal installed server, a virtual machine, or WSL on Windows.
    In this quickstart we will refer to it as "_the launcher_".
    All the examples are using an Ubuntu server.
- You have the following installed command tools in your launcher: `make`, `terraform`, `docker`, `kubectl`, `helm`, `jq`.
- You have installed AWS CLI.
- A valid **AWS account and access credentials**.

## Usage

### Deploy an EKS cluster in AWS

For easier setup we provide a `Makefile` with commands for the  common steps.
You can read the `Makefile` for more info on the specific commands.

Steps:

1. Log in to AWS:
    ```bash
    make aws-login
    ```
    **Note**: This make command wraps a call to `aws sts assume-role`.
    For more details or other alternative authentication methods, see [AWS Sign in methods](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/how-to-sign-in.html).

2. Copy the provided example `terraform.tfvars.example` to a new file, for example `terraform.tfvars`.
    Read and modify as needed the deployment configuration variables in the `terraform.tfvars` file.
    Read the file `variables.tf` and the other template files (`*.tf`) for more variables and usage.
    Remember that you can (and should) modify the templates included in this quickstart to adapt them to your needs.

   **Note**: In the configuration files, you need to provide with valid EKS cluster and node IAM roles.
   Check for already existing EKS cluster and node roles or create new ones.
   For that, follow the steps in [Amazon EKS cluster IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html)
   and [Amazon EKS node IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-role.html)
   or execute:
    ```bash
    make aws-create-eks-roles
    ```
   This step not part of the main infrastructure template, since you only require to do it once.
   For production systems, you may want to create different roles for different clusters.

3. Init your Terraform workspace (fetch/update Terraform plugins and modules):
    ```bash
    make init
    ```

4. Plan (preview the changes Terraform will make before you apply):
    ```bash
    make plan
    ```

5. Apply (makes the changes defined by your plan to create, update, or destroy resources):
    ```bash
    make apply
    ```
   **Note**: The Terraform deployment takes around 10 min.
   Note that the resources may take some more minutes to be ready.

6. Add the EKS configuration to your kubectl config:
    ```bash
    make aws-eks-cfg-kubectl
    ```

7. Show the created K8s cluster configuration:
    ```bash
    make aws-eks-show
    ```

8. Log in to the created Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to be able to push images:
    ```bash
    make aws-ecr-login
    ```

9. Set REGISTRY variable to point to the created registry:
    ```bash
    make aws-ecr-show
    ```
   Set the REGISTRY variable in your environment as indicated from the previous output.
   For example:
    ```bash
    export REGISTRY=11112222233333.dkr.ecr.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com
    ```

### Deploy Spotfire in the created EKS cluster

Now we use the Spotfire CDK to build the Spotfire container images and Helm charts and deploy Spotfire in the created K8s cluster.

1. Change to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../spotfire-cdk-quickstart
    ```

2. Follow the steps in [Deploy Spotfire on a kubernetes cluster using the Spotfire CDK](../spotfire-cdk-quickstart/README.md).

### Clean up

When you are done, remember to destroy the created resources to avoid unneeded costs.
```bash
make destroy
```

### Other

See other useful commands included in the provided 'Makefile':
```bash
make
```

## What to do next

There are further ways to customize this quickstart:

- Enable SSL connections
- Add external user authorization and authentication
- Use AWS RDS as the Spotfire database
- Add a Spotfire action log database
- Use multiple regions
- etc.

Please, see the [SpotfireÂ® Server and Environment - Installation and Administration](https://docs.tibco.com/pub/spotfire_server/latest/doc/html/TIB_sfire_server_tsas_admin_help/server/topics/getting_started.html) documentation for details on specific Spotfire administration and configuration procedures.
