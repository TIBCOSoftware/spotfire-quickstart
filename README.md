# Quickstart for TIBCO Spotfire速 

## Introduction

The purpose of this repo is to share diverse examples showing how to automatically deploy the TIBCO Spotfire速 platform using different common configuration management tools.

This repository does not include any Spotfire速 software or any other third party software. This repository contains mainly quick guides, templates, configuration examples and scripts.

The purpose of the quickstart examples is to provide a starting point for automatic deployment of Spotfire in any environment. The quickstart examples can be easily extended and customized.

The quickstart examples have been verified with Spotfire 11.x series, but they may work for previous Spotfire versions with minimal modifications.

Have fun !!!
