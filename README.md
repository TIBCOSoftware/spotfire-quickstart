# Quickstart for Spotfire®

## Introduction

The purpose of this repo is to share diverse examples showing how to automatically deploy the [Spotfire® platform](https://www.spotfire.com/) using different common configuration management tools.

This repository does not include any Spotfire® software or any other third party software.
This repository contains mainly quick guides, templates, configuration examples and scripts.

The purpose of these quickstart examples is to provide a starting point for automatic deployment of Spotfire anywhere: on premises or on any cloud provider.
These quickstart examples can be easily extended and customized.

**Note**: These quickstart examples have been verified with Spotfire 12.5, but they may work for other Spotfire versions with minimal modifications.

Have fun !!!
