# Automatic Deployment of Spotfire Platform on Azure using Terraform + Ansible

[[_TOC_]]

## Overview

This **Spotfire QuickStart** example shows how to automatically deploy the Spotfire Platform on Azure 
using the 2 of the most commonly used agnostic configuration management tools:
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
- [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible).

**Note**: The purpose of this quickstart example is to provide a starting point for automatic deployment of Spotfire.
This quickstart is not for product usage.
This quickstart example can be easily extended and customized for production usage.

**Note**: This quickstart example has been verified with Spotfire 12.0.0+ series, but it may work for other Spotfire versions with minimal modifications.

### Which kind of Spotfire deployment is deployed by this quickstart example?

This example follows the [Basic installation process for Spotfire](https://docs.tibco.com/pub/spotfire_server/latest/doc/html/TIB_sfire_server_tsas_admin_help/server/topics/basic_installation_process_for_spotfire.html)
from the [TIBCO SpotfireÂ® Server and Environment - Installation and Administration](https://docs.tibco.com/pub/spotfire_server/latest/doc/html/TIB_sfire_server_tsas_admin_help/server/topics/getting_started.html).

This basic installation will deploy the following components:
- Virtual Private Cloud (Azure Virtual Network) and subnetworks.
- Jump-host server VMs for administration of the TIBCO Spotfire VMs.
- TIBCO Spotfire Server VMs (using Azure Linux Virtual Machine instances).
- TIBCO Spotfire Web Player VMs (using Azure Windows Virtual Machine instances).
- TIBCO Spotfire database (using Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server).
- Load balancer (using Azure Application Gateway) (optional).
- Azure Bastion host to manage Windows servers (optional).

**Note**: This deployment has been verified with Azure Linux Virtual Machine instances with Debian 11.

**Note**: For quick testing purposes you may want to avoid creating an Azure Application Gateway,
since it requires some time (~20 min) to be created in Azure. 
In that case, you need to enable creation of tss public ip address to access the application directly (more details below).

**Note**: Optionally, You can [connect to a Windows host with RDP using a jumphost](docs/Connect-with-RDP-using-jumphost.md), without the need of a dedicated Azure Bastion host.

The following diagram shows the deployed environment by this _Quickstart for TIBCO Spotfire in Azure_.

## Prerequisites

- Required **TIBCO Spotfire** installation packages. You can download them from [TIBCO eDelivery](https://edelivery.tibco.com/storefront/index.ep):
    - TIBCO Spotfire Server: Linux tar.gz package:
        - `tss-<version>.x86_64.tar.gz`
    - TIBCO Spotfire node manager: Linux tar.gz package:
        - `tsnm-<version>.x86_64.tar.gz`
    - TIBCO Spotfire distribution files (the distribution files can contain packages for clients, services or customizations):
        - `Spotfire.Dxp.sdn`
        - `Spotfire.Dxp.netcore-linux.sdn`
- A **Linux host** with admin permissions to build and execute the containers.
  You can use a bare metal installed server, a virtual machine, or WSL on Windows.
  In this quickstart we will refer to it as "_the launcher_".
  All the examples are using an Ubuntu server.
- A valid **Azure account with access credentials**.

**Note**: In this example we use a Debian/Ubuntu host to run Terraform and Ansible, but you can use any Linux distro.
See the corresponding vendor instructions for using other operating systems.

## Launcher setup

1. Clone this repo into a folder in your launcher host:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/spotfiresoftware/spotfire-quickstart
    ```

2. Download the Spotfire software and copy the files into `<this_repo_root>/swrepo/build`:
    - `tss-<version>.x86_64.tar.gz`
    - `tsnm-<version>.x86_64.tar.gz`
    - `Spotfire.Dxp.sdn`
    - `Spotfire.Dxp.netcore-linux.sdn`
    - `scripts/`

    **Note**: See the [Spotfire software repository](../../swrepo/build/README.md) for more information.

3. You need to install the required configuration management applications.

   For using the configuration management applications from a bare-metal server, VM or WSL,
   follow the [Install the Configuration Management applications](docs/Setup.md) instructions to manually install and configure Azure CLI, Terraform and Ansible in your launcher.

   For your convenience, there is a `Makefile` that enables you to use Terraform and Ansible commands via the `make` command from the Terraform templates folder (`<this_repo_root>/terraform/azure`).
   This way, you do not need to memorize the syntax, and the commands are much simpler.

   **Note**: You can create an alias to execute `make` from any directory:
    ```bash
    cd <this_repo_root>/terraform/gcp
    alias tsa="make --directory $PWD"
    ```

    **Note**: If you want to know about the details and understand what is going under the hood,
    you can check the [Detailed instructions](docs/Detailed-instructions.md).

    **Note**: As an alternative, for using the configuration management applications from containers (experimental),  
    follow the [Build spotfire-autodeploy container](../../autodeploy/dockers/spotfire-autodeploy-buster-slim/README.md) instructions to build an "all-in-one" container including Azure CLI, Terraform and Ansible configuration management applications.

4. Generate SSH keys (if you do not have them already):
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "spotfire-deploy-azure" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_azure -N ""
    ```

## Usage

The deployment life cycle consists of these steps:

- Prepare your launcher host
- Configure the target environment
- Create the required infrastructure (with Terraform)
- Deploy the Spotfire software (with Ansible)
- Resize or reconfigure the created environment
- Destroy the created environment

### Prepare your launcher host

1. Initiate your environment (it installs and upgrades required Terraform modules):
    ```bash
    make init
    ```

2. If not already done, sign in into Azure with the Azure CLI:
    ```bash
    make azlogin --use-device-code
    ```
    **Note**: For more details, see [Install the applications](docs/Setup.md).

### Configure the target environment

3. You can customize the **deployment environment** by editing the file `terraform.env`.

   **Note**: You need to use a different `TF_WORKSPACE` for applying different environments for the same location.

4. You can customize the **infrastructure settings** like number of instances or sizing, by modifying the `terraform.env`, `variables.tfvars` and `vars-size-XS.tfvars`.
   Open the files for listing the existing configuration variables, description and documentation links.

   **Note**: You need to use a different `prefix` in `variables.tfvars` for applying multiple environments using the same account.

   **Note**: You need to modify the `admin_address_prefixes` and `web_address_prefixes` variables,
   so you allow infra admin and end user access to the environment from your respective selected address blocks
   (you can find your public ip address for example in https://whatismyipaddress.com/).

   **Note**: We may decide to not create an Azure Application Gateway, or an Azure Bastion,
   since it takes some time, money, and it may not be very interesting for very small test environments (like 1tss+1tswp).
   Check in `vars-size-XS.tfvars` the variables that control *resource creation and sizing*.

   **Note**: If you choose to not creating an Azure Application Gateway, you need to choose to create public ip addresses for your tss hosts.

   **Note**: The `vars-size-XS.tfvars` settings overrides `variables.tfvars` settings.

5. If you want to change **Spotfire application settings** (like the Spotfire version, config-tool and web admin credentials,...), review and edit the file `ansible/config/vars.yml`.

   **Note**: The variables in `ansible/config/vars.yml` are used as defaults and may be overriden by previous configuration files.

### Create the required infrastructure (Terraform)

6. Verify the planed infrastructure changes before applying them:
    ```bash
    make plan
    ```

7. If you agree with the planned changes, apply them to create the infrastructure:
    ```bash
    make apply
    ```
   **Note**: This step may take 15-30 minutes depending on the sizing:

### Deploy the Spotfire software (Ansible)

8. Once the infrastructure is in place, you can deploy the software:
    ```bash
    make deploy
    ```

### Resize or reconfigure the created environment

9. You can resize or change your system's configuration by editing again the named configuration files and repeating steps 4-8_:
    ```bash
    make plan
    make apply
    make deploy
    ```

    **Note**: You can use a similar `deploy` command as above to limit the deployment to a specific type of server.
    For example if you only increased the number of VM instances for the Web Player servers you can just deploy those with:
    ```bash
    make deploy ANSIBLE_EXTRA_ARGS="--limit wp_servers"
    ```

### Destroy the created environment

10. Remember to destroy the environment when you are not going to use it to avoid unneeded costs:
    ```bash
    make destroy
    ```

    **Note**: You may need to execute this command a couple of times to destroy all the resources.
    This sometimes happens if the resources is being access.

## Use your environment

1. You can find details for the created environment using:
    ```bash
    make show-hosts
    make show-lb
    ```

   There are more `show-*` command aliases preconfigured to retrieve basic information on your system.
   Run `tsa` without arguments to see the command help.

2. Open the TIBCO Spotfire server web UI:
    - If you chose to create public ip addresses for you tss server(s), you can connect to the tss using `http://<your-tss-ip-address>`.
    - If you chose to create an Azure Application Gateway, you can connect to the tss cluster using `http://<your-azure-app-gw-ip-address>`.

## What to do next

There are further ways to customize this quickstart:

- Enable SSL connections
- Add other Spotfire services
- Add external user authorization and authentication
- Add a Spotfire action log database
- Add Azure Object storage for the Spotfire library items storage
- Use multiple Azure regions
- etc.
